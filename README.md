### SumMakesIndices
Find indices of two int values that make sum. 

    int[] solve(int[] array, int target)
    
- `array` array of ints in what you want to find indices
- `target` sum of elements which indices you want to find
- `solve` returns array of two indices that makes sum

We can assume that there is only one option and it is exactly. Elements can be unsorted
